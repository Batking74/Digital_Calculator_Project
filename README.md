# Digital Calculator Project

### Description
In this enjoyable practice project from 2021, I embarked on the creation of a simple calculator using technologies I taught myself. Beyond being a fun endeavor, it provided a practical application for my coding skills, allowing me to reinforce my understanding of the technologies. Notably, the project also served as a platform to apply my knowledge of mathematical concepts, including factorials and logarithms. This dual-purpose initiative reflects my commitment to both technical proficiency and the practical application of mathematical principles in a creative context.
